# Step 1: after setting php environment variable
$ php ./server.php
```

When you see no output and the command seems to hang that's when you know its running.


# Step 2: Point a webserver to the chat directory

In the chat directory you will find index.php. This file will be the client for your chat application. Make sure you set any
webserver its document root to this location.

# Step 3: Chat away!

Now open up 2 chat tabs and point them to localhost (or maybe a virtual host you configured) and chat away with your self.
